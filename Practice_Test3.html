                answer: "To ensure a specific device always receives the same IP address",

                answer: "Print provider sends the file directly to the printer",
                explanation: "In the Windows printing process, the Print Monitor pulls the file from the spooler's disk storage and sends it to the printer, not the Print Provider directly. The Print Provider works with the Print Processor to format the file.<br><i>Reference: Week6-PrintingServices.pdf, Page 11: 'The Printing Process: • Print monitor pulls file from spooler’s disk storage and sends it to printer'</i>"
